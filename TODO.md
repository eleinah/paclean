# TODO

- [ ] Fix performance when loading the app and clearing packages (use async/await?)
- [ ] Add support for Flatpaks
- [ ] Add support for AppImages
- [ ] Clean up logging/make it custom (right now it's just using cmd output)


*Ideally, I'd like to rewrite this from scratch in Go eventually.*
