# TODO

- [ ] Fix performance when loading the app and clearing packages (use async/await?)
- [ ] Expand on the "Are you sure?" prompt to make it even more fool-proof
- [ ] Implement cmd line args for better user customization instead of hardcoded values/paths (for logging)
- [ ] Clean up logging/make it custom (right now it's just using cmd output): total size freed, total selected, how much cleared in cache, etc.
- [ ] Package & release on GitHub + AUR
